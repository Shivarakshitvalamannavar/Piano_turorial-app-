```
npm install
npm start
```
This will render only  the project's frontend we still have to connect the backend 

###TO run the server 

node server/server.js


After you run this command it will automatically load the songs which are in the database and you can view them and practice 


If you get a `react-scripts start` error, then remove the `node_modules`
folder and re-run the two commands in the code block.
